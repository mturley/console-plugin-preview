// See node_modules/console/frontend/public/plugins.ts
// The '@console/active-plugins' module is generated during a webpack build of the console.
// It is for static plugins, which we don't care about here, so we just stub it out to always be empty.
// This is aliased as @console/active-plugins by the paths option in tsconfig.json.
